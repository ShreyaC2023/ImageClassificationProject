# Machine Learning Classifier

This repository contains Python code that demonstrates a simple machine learning workflow for classification using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The code loads and preprocesses data, splits it into training, validation, and test sets, standardizes features, trains an SVM classifier, and evaluates its performance.

## Introduction

The provided Python script demonstrates a typical machine learning classification workflow. It can be used as a starting point for building and evaluating classification models using SVM.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-classifier.git

## Code Explanation

- **Import necessary libraries:** The code begins by importing required Python libraries, including NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn's `train_test_split`, `StandardScaler`, `SVC` (Support Vector Classifier), and `accuracy_score`.

- **Load and preprocess data:** The data is loaded from the 'flower_and_tumor_data.csv' file (replace with your actual data loading code). Features (X) and labels (y) are separated.

- **Split data:** The data is split into training, validation, and test sets using `train_test_split`. It's common to use an 80-10-10 or similar split ratio.

- **Standardize features:** Features are standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure that all features have the same scale.

- **Train an SVM classifier:** An SVM classifier with a linear kernel and a regularization parameter C=1 is created and trained on the training data.

- **Make predictions on validation set:** The trained model is used to make predictions on the validation set (X_val_scaled), and the predictions are stored in `y_val_pred`.

- **Evaluate the model on validation set:** The code calculates the validation accuracy using `accuracy_score` and prints the result.

- **Make predictions on test set:** The model is then used to make predictions on the test set (X_test_scaled), and the predictions are stored in `y_test_pred`.

- **Evaluate the model on test set:** The code calculates the test accuracy using `accuracy_score` and prints the result.

- **Print detailed classification report:** Finally, a detailed classification report is generated using `classification_report` and printed to provide insights into model performance, including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
